## Purpose ##
Are you a casual fan? Great! Now when you watch the game you can quickly turn to your phone and read up about "number 12" and how great they've been playing while you've been (not) watching! This app will help you create small talk at the game watching parties (that all of us are attending so often during this global pandemic) so that you seem like a real fan!</br>
This app will be a sports information app that will display NBA team and player information in an easily navigable user interface. It will make it easy and convenient for anyone, from casual to die-hard fans to access stats and info from their device. Whether it's at the arena, on the subway, or in their living room, fans will be able to access the info they want in the convenience they deserve. The information will be made in a list type format with a separate display for specific and more detailed information on games, players, and general statistics.
